First line: DT DTSNAP TEND
  DT     : time step
  DTSNAP : time iterval to printout snapshop (rounded to some integer
           multiple of DT)
  TEND   : time to stop simulation
2nd line: The name of input snapshot file (stoa format)
3rd line: The name of output snapshot file (stoa format),
          first char = "~" implies no snapshot output
4th line: EPS, THETA, NCRIT
  EPS  : softening parameter
  THETA: opening angle
  NCRIT: critcal value of number of particles for TREE-GRAPE algorithm
5th line (Compiled with PGPLOT): size of window
6th line: 0: create collision run
  if 6th line = 1, 7th line is for relative position and velocity
  otherwize, 7th line is for position/velocity scaling
